# Order Management System - Code Explanation

## What This Code Does

A **trading system** that automatically manages buy/sell orders for financial markets.

## How It Works

**3 Main Parts:**
1. **Time Manager** - Watches the clock, logs in/out during trading hours
2. **Order Processor** - Takes orders from queue, sends to exchange  
3. **Response Handler** - Receives confirmations, tracks how fast orders went through

## Key Files

- `order_management.hpp` - Defines the system structure
- `order_management.cpp` - Main logic implementation  
- `main.cpp` - Test program that creates fake orders

## Main Features

- **Auto Login/Logout** - System knows when markets are open
- **Order Queue** - Orders wait in line to be sent
- **Speed Limiting** - Won't send too many orders per second
- **Response Tracking** - Measures how long each order takes
- **Thread Safe** - Multiple parts can run simultaneously without breaking

## Why It's Built This Way

- **Fast** - Uses atomic variables for quick checks
- **Safe** - Mutexes prevent data corruption 
- **Reliable** - Handles errors gracefully
- **Scalable** - Can process thousands of orders per second

## Sample Flow

1. Market opens → System logs in automatically
2. New order arrives → Goes into queue
3. Order processor → Sends order to exchange
4. Exchange responds → System logs the result
5. Market closes → System logs out automatically

**Result:** Orders processed in microseconds with full tracking and logging.
